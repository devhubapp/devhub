## Why

DevHub helps you take back control of your GitHub workflow and stay on top of everything important going on.

## Features

- [x] **Columns layout**: Like TweetDeck, you can see at a quick glance everything that is going on; made for power users;
- [x] **Inbox Zero**: Clear all the seen items and keep your mind clean; Archived items will be moved to a separate place;
- [x] **Filters**: Apply different filters to each column; remove all the noise and make them show just what you want;
- [x] **Enhanced notifications**: See all the relevant information before opening the notification, like issue/pull request status, comment content, release description, etc.;
- [x] **Sanely watch repositories**: Keep up to date with repositories' activities without using the `watch` feature so your notifications don't get cluttered;
- [x] **Stalker mode**: Follow user activities without using the `follow` button and see activities that GitHub doesn't show on your feed, like issue comments and pushed commits;
- [x] **Dashboard viewer**: See other users' home screen (their GitHub dashboard) so you can discover new interesting people and repositories;
- [x] **Save for later**: Save any activity or notification for later, so you don't forget to get back to them;
- [x] **Theme support**: Choose between 6 light or dark themes;
- [x] **And more!**: Desktop apps, native mobile apps, open source, modern tech stack, ...

#### About paid features

##### What features will be paid?

- Support for GitHub Enterprise

##### Why is this app not completely free?

> "If you find something you think is cool then give that person some money for it so they can make more things you think are cool" 💙

DevHub plans to be a sustainable open source project. It's not made by a huge company like Facebook. It is made by a single developer that could be making $200k on Facebook, but instead makes $0 working on this full time. DevHub does not intend to work with donations and, instead, plans to create real value for its users and have a few paid features. If you want the project to live and be actively maintained, understand that it will need a revenue and consider subscribing to the paid plan once it launches.

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests and other contributions are more than welcome! <br/>
Whenever possible, please make a pull request with the implementation instead of just requesting it.

If the feature is big, open an issue first for discussion.

> **Important**: DevHub is a mobile-first cross-platform project. All code syntax targets react-native, not react-dom. Make sure to use `StyleSheet` instead of normal CSS and to test it on both android/ios instead of only the browser.

### Running it locally

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

> **Note:** On Windows, you might need to install Bash commands (e.g. via [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or via [linux bash shell](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/))

#### How to run

- `git clone git@github.com:devhubapp/devhub.git`
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`

That's it. It will start three workers: `TypeScript compilation watcher`, `Web server` (create-react-app) and the `Mobile server` (react-native packager). The browser will open automatically.

>  Alternatives to `yarn dev`: `yarn dev:web`, `yarn dev:desktop`, `yarn dev:mobile`

To open the mobile projects, use:

- `yarn xcode`
- `yarn studio`

### Running it online
Alternatively, you can contribute using Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub:
