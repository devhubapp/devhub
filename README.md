#### About paid features

##### What features will be paid?

- Support for private repositories
- Support for GitHub Enterprise
- Push notifications
- Unlimited number of columns
- Unlimited history of Notifications & Activities
  > GitHub API only returns notifications from the last 7 days and at max 300 activities; the paid feature will allow you to have access to all the data from the past by saving them on DevHub's database

##### Why is this app not completely free?

> "If you find something you think is cool then give that person some money for it so they can make more things you think are cool" üíô

DevHub plans to be a sustainable open source project. It's not made by a huge company like Facebook, it is made by a single developer that could be making $200k+ on Facebook, but instead makes $0 working on this full time. If you want the project to live and be actively maintained, understand that it will need a revenue and consider donating or subscribing to the paid plan once it launches.
